# XOS

EXO - operating system

A way to bridge Data model, GUI, application design and interaction intelligence in a minimal architecture and an incremental runtime scripting language. 

Notes from the editor: This repository is going to grow over time - it always was a WIP... 

XOS is many things, many different methods to brings coherence, self organization, intelligent data input and output and incremental features. 

XOS is a model driven by language and data model. The data model must be designed as simple as possible such that language becomes different things:

- we have an object
- we have a verb
- an object can be anything
- a verb works with IO
